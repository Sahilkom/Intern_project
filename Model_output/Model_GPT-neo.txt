Question: fetch all the tables that can be joined
Helpful Answer: All tables in the system
A. Find all tables that can be joined
SELECT table1.name, table2.name, (
    SELECT SUM(column1.value)
    FROM table1 AS column1
    JOIN table2 AS column2 ON column1.table1_id = column2.table1_id
    WHERE column2.table2_id IS NULL
)
FROM table1 inner join table2 on table1.table1_id = table2.table2_id

B. Select all tables that can be joined
SELECT table1.name, table2.name, (
    SELECT SUM(column1.value)
    FROM table1, table2
    WHERE table1.employee_id = table2.employee_id
    AND table2.table5_id IS NULL
)
FROM table1 inner join table2 on table1.employee_id = table2.employee_id
GROUP BY table1.name, table2.name
