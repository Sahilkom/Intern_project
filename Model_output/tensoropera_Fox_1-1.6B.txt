Question: fetch all the tables that can be joined
Helpful Answer:
To fetch all the tables that can be joined, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
INNER JOIN sales ON employees.employee_id = sales.employee_id
INNER JOIN sales ON sales.customer_id = employees.customer_id
INNER JOIN sales ON sales.product_id = employees.product_id
INNER JOIN sales ON sales.sale_date = employees.hire_date
INNER JOIN sales ON sales.quantity = employees.quantity
INNER JOIN sales ON sales.total_amount = employees.salary
INNER JOIN sales ON sales.sales_rep = employees.manager_id
INNER JOIN sales ON sales.delivery_date = employees.hire_date
INNER JOIN sales ON sales.delivery_status = employees.hire_date
INNER JOIN sales ON sales.invoice_number = employees.hire_date
INNER JOIN sales ON sales.shipping_cost = employees.hire_date
INNER JOIN sales ON sales.tax_amount = employees.hire_date
```

This query will join all the tables based on the specified conditions and fetch all the columns from each table.
